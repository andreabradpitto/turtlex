## 📛 Introduction

This is my repository for my Master Thesis project "Safe Learning for Robotics: Abstraction Techniques for Efficient Verification" for the [Robotics Engineering](https://courses.unige.it/10635) master's degree course study (2019-2021), attended at the [University of Genoa](https://unige.it/en).

## 📂 Repository structure

- [doc](doc): folder containing the 2 versions of the assignment specifications

- [src](src): folder containing the source code of the assignment

- [.gitignore](.gitignore): hidden file that specifies which files and folders are not relevant for [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

- [LICENSE](LICENSE): a plain text file containing the license terms

- [README.md](README.md): this file
