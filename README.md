## ‚úÖ Installation

In order to create the executables, open a terminal, move to this folder, and then run:

```bash
cd catkin_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/andreabradpitto/turtlex.git
cd ..
catkin_make
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Execution

After re-sourcing (i.e., move back to the `catkin_ws` folder with `cd ..`, then type `source devel/setup.bash` and confirm) or opening a new terminal emulator, execute:

```bash
roslaunch turtlex_bt bt.launch
```
