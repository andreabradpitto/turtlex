**This readme is currently incomplete.**

## üìõ Introduction

This is my repository for my Master Thesis project "Safe Learning for Robotics: Abstraction Techniques for Efficient Verification" for the [Robotics Engineering](https://courses.unige.it/10635) master's degree course study (2019-2021), attended at the [University of Genoa](https://unige.it/en).

## üìÇ Repository structure

- [task_behavior_engine](task_behavior_engine), [task_behavior_msgs](task_behavior_msgs), [task_behavior_ros](task_behavior_ros): forked from [Toyota Research Institute](https://github.com/ToyotaResearchInstitute)

- [rosnode](rosnode): forked from [ros_comm](https://github.com/ros/ros_comm)

- [turtlex](turtlex): TODO

- [.gitignore](.gitignore): hidden file that specifies which files and folders are not relevant for [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

- [LICENSE](LICENSE): a plain text file containing the license terms

- [README.md](README.md): this file

## ‚ùó Software requirements

- [ROS Noetic](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation) (full installation recommended)
- [openai_ros](https://bitbucket.org/theconstructcore/openai_ros/src/kinetic-devel/)*
- [OpenaAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/docs/)
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/)
- [MoveIt](https://moveit.ros.org/install/)
- [OpenCV](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d7/d9f/tutorial_linux_install.html)
- [MPI for Python](https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html) (`python -m pip install mpi4py`)
- [pyassimp](https://pypi.org/project/pyassimp/) (`python -m pip install pyassimp`) due to [this](https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/86) issue

* you may need to change the `package.xml` file line `14` from `<build_depend>python-catkin-pkg</build_depend>` to `<build_depend>python3-catkin-pkg</build_depend>`

## ‚úÖ Installation

In order to create the executables, open a terminal, move to this folder, and then run:

```bash
cd catkin_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/andreabradpitto/turtlex.git
cd ..
catkin_make
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Execution

After re-sourcing (i.e., move back to the `catkin_ws` folder with `cd ..`, then type `source devel/setup.bash` and confirm) or opening a new terminal emulator, execute:

```bash
roslaunch turtlex_bt bt.launch
```

In order to run the verification, move to the `verification` folder and execute:

```bash
./nav_sac_ver.py
```

Notice that in order to run the navigation task it is needed to manually modify the `sig_fod()` function in the abstraction.py file of the local installation of pyNeVer (as of version `0.0.1a7`). It has to become equivalent to this:

```python
def sig_fod(x: float) -> float:
    """
    Utility function computing the first order derivative of the logistic function of the input.
    """
    x = np.longdouble(x)  # <class 'numpy.float128'>
    return float(np.exp(-x) / np.power(1 + np.exp(-x), 2))
    #return math.exp(-x) / math.pow(1 + math.exp(-x), 2)
```
